									<h1>University Capstone Project</h1>
								</header>

								<!-- Text stuff -->
									<p>The capstone project was presented as a course requirement by The University of Victoria Mechanical Engineering Department.
										This project was done by the engineering team that consisted of myself, Jersey Kertawidjaja, and three other mechanical
										engineering students: <b>Duncan Wallace</b>, <b>Nipuna Fernando</b>, and <b>Brandon Nolan</b>. Without my team members and the teaching assistants,
										<b>Adam Johnson</b> and <b>Shima Akar</b>
										this project would be much too overwhelming.
									</p>
									<h2>Background</h2>
									
									<p>Global Solution Universe Inc. (GSU) is recommending their client (which will be referred to as the
									“treatment plant” to maintain confidentiality) to implement a supplemental aeration system into their
									existing aeration basin/lagoon, in addition to their already existing surface aerators. The injector nozzle
									proposed will inject aerated oxygen into the bottom of the lagoon. GSU would be sourcing a venturi
									nozzle and injector nozzles from Mazzei Injector Company LLC. (MICL), a company that design and build
									the injectors. Whilst the piping and manifold specifications would be sourced from Engineered Pipe
									Group (EPG).</p>

									<h2>My Work</h2>
									
									<h3>Initial Modelling of Manifold Array</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_segmented.jpg" alt="" /></span>For my part, the initial 3D conceptualization of the manifold array was the first major task I did. The task was not as simple as it seems. The main issue arose due to the fact that
										the manifold was not finished up to a detail design. And since the initial scope of the project was not to design the manifold itself, the team was slightly unprepared. I took the initiative
										to talk with Engineering Pipe Group (EPG), the people responsible for finalizing the design of the manifold, and finialized the 3D model of the manifold using SolidWorks. The manifold array can be seen on the right.
									</p>
									<h3>Initial Modelling of Support Brackets</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/capstone/chassis design 1.png" alt="" /></span>Although the team modeled the final design in collaborative session, <b>I did some preliminary design for the support chassis based on one of the concepts generated in a brainstorming session</b>.
										Since it was the first iteration, it looked a bit simple. But it provided a good foundation, especially a good stepping stone when the team was dealing with "connections" in the  static simulations.
										<br /><br />
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/capstone/support2iso.png" alt="" /></span>The challenge was trying to simulate the bracket with as close similarity to how it would be physically. As can be seen in the first iteration, the
										design utilized water-jet cut materials welded to metal tubing of the same material. The issue I came across was that SolidWorks did not have a sophisticated weld connection feature, and it did not
										like the weld connection that was made in the initial designs.<b> Hence the final design only composed of a single cut part out from a sheet, of which then be welded on to the skid (cut and formed),
										which not only benifited in the simplification of the connections, but provide less stress concentrations as well</b>.
									</p>

									<h3>Supporting Vibrational Analysis</h3>
									<p>Any system with rotating equipments, a study of vibrational analysis is very important. In our case, the pump will be rotating at around 24 Hz. It is important that excitation
										frequency does not reside in the natural frequency of the system or the peak of the first three modes.<br /><br />

										<span class="image left"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_vibrational_setup.jpg" alt="" /></span>The vibrational study was iterated as much as the bracket structural analysis, since the natural frequency would change due to any physical changes into the system. <b>I was a part of setting up the assembly (pipe manifold + bracket)
										in SolidWorks to conduct a Frequency study. I correctly applied the present forces, such as the gravity and the thrust applied by the nozzles, and the correct connections, like how the skids would interact
										witht the floor and walls of the pool</b>.<br /><br />

										Depicted in the image below, the Cumulative Excitation Mass Participation Factor (CEMPF) values along any given direction,remain constrained within 25 % range (prior to the excitation frequency of 24 Hz).
										The excitation frequency also resides far away from the first three modes, where the excitation is more pronounced.

									<h3>Static Analysis</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_weld_connection.jpg" alt="" /></span>The static analysis was a large chunk of the capstone project. I was responsible in conducting simulation on each bracket of the support chassis, making sure all the operating conditions were taken into
										consideration.<br /><br />

										Similar to the vibrational analysis, it is important to correctly provide the proper connections and present forces in a static analysis. SolidWorks was again used for conducting these analysis.<br />

										The forces acting on each bracket was brilliantly found by one of my teamates, Duncan, which comprises of the segmentation of the manifold and generation of a shear stress and moment diagram to find corresponding reactions
										at each longitudinal position of the array. With these forces, the static simulation was able to be conducted. <b>Below are the some of the results of the static simulations that I conducted:</b>

									<h3>Fatigue Analysis</h3>
									<p>Not unlike vibrational analysis, fatigue is a crucial aspect of a design under continous loading. Even all objects subjet to constant loading have small fluctuations. Such is the case for the support chassis.
										Rotating equipments, such as a pump, would case quite of a bit of fluctiations on the loading. Hence a 10% variation to the loading (R value = 0.9) was determined. But prior to conducting the fatigue analysis,
										a stress-cycle relationship must be established for the material. <b>I read from a report done by The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commision, who conducted several tests on the 
										environmental effects on fatigue testing. Conviniently, the material of our choice (316 Stainless-steel) an Austenitic steel, was a part of the study.
										</b><br /><br /> Based on the study, it was found that it is appropriate to use the stress-cycle relationship tabulated by ASME data because an immersion of the metal into the aeration lagoon temperature (25 °𝐶 - 50 °𝐶) did not affect yield strength greatly.<br /><br />

										Another consideration was made regarding the acidic nature of the aeration lagoon. A paper by The University of Žilina discussed the fatigue testing for high-cyclical lifetime (1E7 to 1E9 cycles) on marine grade 316 stainless steel affected by corrosion.
										The test found the yield strength of the steel dropped to 65 MPa after 2E9 cycles. The study was conducted with 12 𝑚𝑚 diameter cylindrical steel samples etched with a
										mixture of acid and glycerin, with fully reversed (loading ratio 𝑅 = −1) with a frequency of 20 𝑘𝐻𝑧 up
										to 2E9 𝑐𝑦𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑠. <br /> <br />


										<b>Based on these information, I generated a more conservative stress-cycle relationship that took into consideration effects of the relevant wastewater:</b>

									<h3>Draughting</h3>
									<p>Additional to the technical responsibilites I had in the project, I also conducted a lot of the draughting, espcially when generating neat images to illustrate ideas in the
										final report. <b>Below are some of the images I generated through AutoCAD:</b>
