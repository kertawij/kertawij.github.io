									<h2>Background</h2>
									<p>The capstone project was presented as a course requirement by The University of Victoria Mechanical Engineering Department.
									This project was done by the engineering team that consisted of myself, Jersey Kertawidjaja, and three other mechanical
									engineering students: Duncan Wallace, Nipuna Fernando, and Brandon Nolan. Without my team members and the teaching assistants,
									this project would much too overwhelming.<p>
									
									<p>Global Solution Universe Inc. (GSU) is recommending their client (which will be referred to as the
									“treatment plant” to maintain confidentiality) to implement a supplemental aeration system into their
									existing aeration basin/lagoon, in addition to their already existing surface aerators. The injector nozzle
									proposed will inject aerated oxygen into the bottom of the lagoon. GSU would be sourcing a venturi
									nozzle and injector nozzles from Mazzei Injector Company LLC. (MICL), a company that design and build
									the injectors. Whilst the piping and manifold specifications would be sourced from Engineered Pipe
									Group (EPG).</p>

									<h2>Objectives</h2>
									<p>The primary objective of this project is to design a support chassis for the injector manifold, enabling
									safe and efficient installation and inspection while the treatment plant continues its operations. The
									project will address various loading conditions, including operation, installation, and inspection, to
									ensure the structural integrity of the injector system.
									The successful implementation of the supplemental aeration system and the ability to inspect and
									maintain the injectors over at least five years will have profound implications for the client. Firstly, it will
									enhance the overall treatment efficiency and effectiveness of the plant, leading to improved water
									quality and environmental preservation. Secondly, the ability to conduct inspections without
									interrupting operations will significantly reduce downtime and operational costs, ultimately benefiting
									the client's financial sustainability.</p>

									<h2>Final Design</h2>
									<p>The final design of the piping manifold was a culmination of a thorough and comprehensive process that
									involved simulation analysis, extensive client consultation, and meticulous material selection and
									research. By leveraging these key factors, the design team was able to develop a robust and optimized
									solution to meet the project's objectives and requirements.</p>
									
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_thumbnail.jpeg" alt="" /></span>Throughout the design process, simulations played a crucial role in validating the structural integrity and
									performance of the support chassis. Advanced simulation tools allowed the team to
									assess the stress distribution, load bearing capacity, and deflection of the design under two critical
									loading scenarios. As a result, weak points were identified and addressed early in the design phase,
									leading to an optimized and reliable final solution. Client consultation and feedback were paramount in
									shaping the final design. Regular meetings and discussions with the client allowed the design team to
									gain valuable insights into specific needs and preferences of the end-user. By incorporating the client's
									input, the final design not only met technical specifications but also aligned perfectly with the client's
									vision and requirements.</p>
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_retainer.jpg" alt="" /></span>Additional to the chassis the team wanted to incorporate a method of retaining the downpipe of the manifold from tipping during extraction.
									The team investigated many different solutions such as custom brackets or chains but ended up with the design pictured below utilizing rope
									and wraparound cleats.</p></br />

									<p>One of the first steps taken in analysing the chassis design was an estimation of the loads and reactions experienced by the chassis supports. This was achieved by first examining
									the forces the manifold itself would be subject to under a determined set of conditions. </p>

									<h2>Load Analysis</h2>
									<p>One of the first steps taken in analysing the chassis design was an estimation of the loads and reactions experienced by the chassis supports. This was achieved by first examining the forces the manifold itself would be subject
									 to under a determined set of conditions. </p>
									<h3>Identification of Loads</h3>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">

											<h4>Dryweight</h4>
											<ul>
												<p>The empty manifold is supported by the chassis which is in contact with the ground. The ensemble is un-immersed. The only body force experienced is gravity.</p>
											</ul>

											<h4>Static</h4>
											<ul class="alt">
												<p>The manifold and chassis are seated at the bottom of a lagoon and immersed in a prescribed depth of wastewater, the manifold is not operational and thus
												the manifold internal control volume also hosts still wastewater in equilibrium with the free surface.</p>
											</ul>

										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">

											<h4>Operational</h4>
											<ul>
												<p>As with the prior condition, the manifold and chassis are seated at the bottom of the lagoon and immersed in a prescribed depth of wastewater, however the
												manifold is in an operational state. The internal control volume of the manifold hosts aerated wastewater however and the manifold is subject to thrust loading.</p>
											</ul>

											<h4>Lifting</h4>
											<ul class="alt">
												<p>The un-immersed and empty manifold and chassis see no planar support as they are lifted by hoist-points located on the chassis.</p>
											</ul>

										</div>
									</div>
									<h3>Segmenting the Manifold</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_segmented.jpg" alt="" /></span>As the manifold is a large assembly with complex geometry the approach for load analysis would be simplified consisted of
										breaking the manifold up into smaller segments and proceeding in a piece-wise manner. After which, the loading on the support chassis via the connected pieces could be conducted. The relevant forces acting on each manifold
										segment were gravity, bouyancy, and the thrust presented by the injectors. The physical properties for each segment were obtained using SolidWorks and consisted of finding volumes, masses, spans, and centroids for both the
										external (shell) and internal (water and/or air) segment regions. These properties were then aggregated in a spreadsheet and used to calculate the net forces acting on each segment. The calculated segment
										forces were then mapped out along the span of the manifold (see image below of the partial spreadsheet), from this shear-bending moment diagrams could be made and the reactions at each of the supports could be found
										(see Free Body Diagrams). This was done for all load cases except Lifting, as it represents a more complex case and requires prior knowledge of the chassis mass and geometry.

									<h2>Bracket Simulation</h2>
									<p> The analysis of the design chassis utilizes the loads obtained from the load analysis. The most critical loading scenarios involve the bracket bearing the individual forces presented by the thrust of the nozzles. SolidWorks Static simulations
										were utilized to obtain a Von-Mises stress map to indicate the highest stress present in each bracket. Within computational analysis the correct materials, connections between parts, restraints (immovable points to set a boundary condition)
										and loading needs to be specified. SolidWorks static simulations offer a diverse repertoire of materials complete with property sheets, which conveniently includes AISI 316 grade stainless steel
										
									</p>
									<h3>Simulation Connections and Restraints</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_weld_connection.jpg" alt="" /></span>For the single unit analysis, the component interactions (intersection, adhesion) were limited to a bonding contact, emulating a component or model with constituent bodies that had been welded or adhered together. In order to prevent interference
										(merging) of the solid materials, a global contact interaction was established. Although a global interaction was set, the part consists of two to three metal components that needs to be welded together. For this an edge weld connection
										was applied to the relevant corners. This feature would then be used as a reference for the recommended weld diameter at the end of the simulation. The edge-weld connections are located in between contacting edges of any stainless-steel
										parts.
									</p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_chassi_lagoon.jpg" alt="" /></span>Fixtures are required to set a boundary condition in a stress simulation. Fixing the proper geometry on the part analysed is a crucial part of the analysis. The selection of the restraints within the simulation shall model accurately on how the part is restrained in its real-life application.
										the image on the left shows how the chassis will interact with the lagoon floor and walls while it is in its operating condition. The chassis will not be bolted down unto the lagoon (neither the floor, nor the walls). The sheer weight of the manifold and chassis will provide the downforce 
										required to anchor the array. With the addition of the thrust generated from the nozzle that will push up the chassis skids against the wall, the manifold will be secured throughout operation.
									</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_chassi_fixtures.jpg" alt="" /></span> The image on the right shows the chosen fixtures that the team believed to be the best way to represent the real-life restraints. A virtual wall will be modeled for the wall and floor of the lagoon, it will only allow compressive action of the part against those walls.
										An edge at the corner of the skid plate will be a fixed geometry, not able to be displaced. These restraints are not a 100% accurate, although it is the best representation that allows for a single stress unit analysis. A more accurate restraint
										representation could be modeled, but the manifold system would need to be included in the analysis as well. Although the numerous complicated connections and computational time might not be worth the results.
									</p>

									<h3>Bracket Loading</h3>
									<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_loading.jpg" alt="" /></span>The external forces are applied on the parts as a “bearing load”, as it would allow for a sinusoidal distribution of the load from the manifold onto the support. Split lines were made in order to allow selections of the relevant faces that would be affected by the forces,
										as illustrated.
