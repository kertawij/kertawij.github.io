									<h1>Spillway Hoist Motor and Brake Upgrade</h1>
								</header>

								<!-- Text stuff -->
									<h2>Background And Objectives</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/spillway/site/site 6.jpg" alt="" /></span>BBA Engineering (BBA) is conducting an upgrade on the instrumentation of a pair of radial spillway gate of one their client's hydro generation site.<br /><br />
										
										One of the upgrades to be included would be the motor hoisting the gates. The drive motor of the hoist is located on the spillway pier, with each gate having their own individual hoist motor.
										Below is an image indicating the hoist motor assembly. The drive motor drives a shaft through a worm gear reducer to transmit its motion to the hoists. <b>The objective of the drive motor is
										to simply remove the existing drive motor with a like-for-like motor, with the addition of a through shaft modification.</b> This request was made for an emergency scenario where the hoist must be lifted up manually with a coupled hand-drill.<br /><br />

										<span class="image left"><img src="images/spillway/site/site 2.jpg" alt="" /></span>The hoisting motor is connected to the worm gear differential via a brake drum coupling. The fucntion of the mechanical brake is to assist the worm gear differential
										at holding the gate at a certain level of opening. The brake drum would then release whenever the drive motor would either open or close the gate. The brake that the client currently have on site is a solenoid brake that had failed numerous times
										(not being able to release the drum and allow the motor to turn the gate). <br /><br />

										The mechanical brake of the hoist motor would need to be replaced as per the specific design constraints stated by the client:
										<b>
										<ol>
											<li>Would meet the capacity of stopping power provided the new specified motor and existing relevant client standards.</li>
											<li>The specified brake would be actuated with a dual-thruster mechanism, that would allow one thruster to actuate in the case of failure of the other</li>
										</ol>
										</b>

										</div>
									</div>
									<p>Specification for the motor was quite straight forward once the standard was used as a reference. Due to the requirement of the dual shaft component most supplier would require to modify/custom make the motor. After communication and utilizing the
										client's hoist motor standard document and the NEMA MG1 standard, it was found that the best motor that would best fit the solution is one of General Electric's 5HP Ultra Motor.<br /><br />

										The motor specified is of size 254T, only differing in mount hole position and a slightly longer shaft. This is not a major issue since the only modification required is the drilling of new bolt holes to the existing skid to allow motor fit.
										In the deliverable drawing, it was also shown how a hand drill could be mounted at the non-driving motor shaft to actuate the gate in the case of an emergency.

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/spillway/motor and brake update/brake_coupling.jpg" alt="" /></span><span class="image right"><img src="images/spillway/motor and brake update/brakes.jpg" alt="" /></span>Similar to the motor, specifying for the dual-thruster brake was straight forward.
										It only required simple calculations to consider for the load capacity of the brake. Following the specifications from the client's standard for crane and hoisting mechanism.
										The specified brake was sourced from Dellener Bubenzer, it would be a custom dual-thruster EBN 200.<br /><br />
										Since the coupling of the brake are not compatible, and (from site observation) it was also noticed that it had gone through deterioration, the brake coupling was also considered.
