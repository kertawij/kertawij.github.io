									<h2>Background</h2>
									<p>The capstone project was presented as a course requirement by The University of Victoria Mechanical Engineering Department.
									This project was done by the engineering team that consisted of myself, Jersey Kertawidjaja, and three other mechanical
									engineering students: <b>Duncan Wallace</b>, <b>Nipuna Fernando</b>, and <b>Brandon Nolan</b>. Without my team members and the teaching assistants,
									<b>Adam Johnson</b> and <b>Shima Akar</b>
									this project would be much too overwhelming.<p>
									
									<p>Global Solution Universe Inc. (GSU) is recommending their client (which will be referred to as the
									“treatment plant” to maintain confidentiality) to implement a supplemental aeration system into their
									existing aeration basin/lagoon, in addition to their already existing surface aerators. The injector nozzle
									proposed will inject aerated oxygen into the bottom of the lagoon. GSU would be sourcing a venturi
									nozzle and injector nozzles from Mazzei Injector Company LLC. (MICL), a company that design and build
									the injectors. Whilst the piping and manifold specifications would be sourced from Engineered Pipe
									Group (EPG).</p>

									<h2>Objectives</h2>
									<p>The primary objective of this project is to design a support chassis for the injector manifold, enabling
									safe and efficient installation and inspection while the treatment plant continues its operations. The
									project will address various loading conditions, including operation, installation, and inspection, to
									ensure the structural integrity of the injector system.
									The successful implementation of the supplemental aeration system and the ability to inspect and
									maintain the injectors over at least five years will have profound implications for the client. Firstly, it will
									enhance the overall treatment efficiency and effectiveness of the plant, leading to improved water
									quality and environmental preservation. Secondly, the ability to conduct inspections without
									interrupting operations will significantly reduce downtime and operational costs, ultimately benefiting
									the client's financial sustainability.</p>

									<h2>Final Design</h2>
									<p>The final design of the piping manifold was a culmination of a thorough and comprehensive process that
									involved simulation analysis, extensive client consultation, and meticulous material selection and
									research. By leveraging these key factors, the design team was able to develop a robust and optimized
									solution to meet the project's objectives and requirements.</p>
									
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_thumbnail.jpeg" alt="" /></span>Throughout the design process, simulations played a crucial role in validating the structural integrity and
									performance of the support chassis. Advanced simulation tools allowed the team to
									assess the stress distribution, load bearing capacity, and deflection of the design under two critical
									loading scenarios. As a result, weak points were identified and addressed early in the design phase,
									leading to an optimized and reliable final solution. Client consultation and feedback were paramount in
									shaping the final design. Regular meetings and discussions with the client allowed the design team to
									gain valuable insights into specific needs and preferences of the end-user. By incorporating the client's
									input, the final design not only met technical specifications but also aligned perfectly with the client's
									vision and requirements.</p>
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_retainer.jpg" alt="" /></span>Additional to the chassis the team wanted to incorporate a method of retaining the downpipe of the manifold from tipping during extraction.
									The team investigated many different solutions such as custom brackets or chains but ended up with the design pictured below utilizing rope
									and wraparound cleats.</p></br />

									<p>One of the first steps taken in analysing the chassis design was an estimation of the loads and reactions experienced by the chassis supports. This was achieved by first examining
									the forces the manifold itself would be subject to under a determined set of conditions. </p>

									<h2>Analysis</h2>
									<p>One of the first steps taken in analysing the chassis design was an estimation of the loads and reactions experienced by the chassis supports. This was achieved by first examining the forces the manifold itself would be subject
									 to under a determined set of conditions. </p>
									<h3>Identification of Loads</h3>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">

											<h4>Dryweight</h4>
											<ul>
												<p>The empty manifold is supported by the chassis which is in contact with the ground. The ensemble is un-immersed. The only body force experienced is gravity.</p>
											</ul>

											<h4>Static</h4>
											<ul class="alt">
												<p>The manifold and chassis are seated at the bottom of a lagoon and immersed in a prescribed depth of wastewater, the manifold is not operational and thus
												the manifold internal control volume also hosts still wastewater in equilibrium with the free surface.</p>
											</ul>

										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">

											<h4>Operational</h4>
											<ul>
												<p>As with the prior condition, the manifold and chassis are seated at the bottom of the lagoon and immersed in a prescribed depth of wastewater, however the
												manifold is in an operational state. The internal control volume of the manifold hosts aerated wastewater however and the manifold is subject to thrust loading.</p>
											</ul>

											<h4>Lifting</h4>
											<ul class="alt">
												<p>The un-immersed and empty manifold and chassis see no planar support as they are lifted by hoist-points located on the chassis.</p>
											</ul>

										</div>
									</div>
									<h3>Segmenting the Manifold</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_segmented.jpg" alt="" /></span>As the manifold is a large assembly with complex geometry the approach for load analysis would be simplified consisted of
										breaking the manifold up into smaller segments and proceeding in a piece-wise manner. After which, the loading on the support chassis via the connected pieces could be conducted. The relevant forces acting on each manifold
										segment were gravity, bouyancy, and the thrust presented by the injectors. The physical properties for each segment were obtained using SolidWorks and consisted of finding volumes, masses, spans, and centroids for both the
										external (shell) and internal (water and/or air) segment regions. These properties were then aggregated in a spreadsheet and used to calculate the net forces acting on each segment. The calculated segment
										forces were then mapped out along the span of the manifold (see image below of the partial spreadsheet), from this shear-bending moment diagrams could be made and the reactions at each of the supports could be found
										(see Free Body Diagrams). This was done for all load cases except Lifting, as it represents a more complex case and requires prior knowledge of the chassis mass and geometry.

									<h2>Bracket Simulation</h2>
									<p> The analysis of the design chassis utilizes the loads obtained from the load analysis. The most critical loading scenarios involve the bracket bearing the individual forces presented by the thrust of the nozzles. SolidWorks Static simulations
										were utilized to obtain a Von-Mises stress map to indicate the highest stress present in each bracket. Within computational analysis the correct materials, connections between parts, restraints (immovable points to set a boundary condition)
										and loading needs to be specified. SolidWorks static simulations offer a diverse repertoire of materials complete with property sheets, which conveniently includes AISI 316 grade stainless steel
										
									</p>
									<h3>Simulation Connections and Restraints</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_weld_connection.jpg" alt="" /></span>For the single unit analysis, the component interactions (intersection, adhesion) were limited to a bonding contact, emulating a component or model with constituent bodies that had been welded or adhered together. In order to prevent interference
										(merging) of the solid materials, a global contact interaction was established. Although a global interaction was set, the part consists of two to three metal components that needs to be welded together. For this an edge weld connection
										was applied to the relevant corners. This feature would then be used as a reference for the recommended weld diameter at the end of the simulation. The edge-weld connections are located in between contacting edges of any stainless-steel
										parts.
									</p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_chassi_lagoon.jpg" alt="" /></span>Fixtures are required to set a boundary condition in a stress simulation. Fixing the proper geometry on the part analysed is a crucial part of the analysis. The selection of the restraints within the simulation shall model accurately on how the part is restrained in its real-life application.
										the image on the left shows how the chassis will interact with the lagoon floor and walls while it is in its operating condition. The chassis will not be bolted down unto the lagoon (neither the floor, nor the walls). The sheer weight of the manifold and chassis will provide the downforce 
										required to anchor the array. With the addition of the thrust generated from the nozzle that will push up the chassis skids against the wall, the manifold will be secured throughout operation.
									</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_chassi_fixtures.jpg" alt="" /></span> The image on the right shows the chosen fixtures that the team believed to be the best way to represent the real-life restraints. A virtual wall will be modeled for the wall and floor of the lagoon, it will only allow compressive action of the part against those walls.
										An edge at the corner of the skid plate will be a fixed geometry, not able to be displaced. These restraints are not a 100% accurate, although it is the best representation that allows for a single stress unit analysis. A more accurate restraint
										representation could be modeled, but the manifold system would need to be included in the analysis as well. Although the numerous complicated connections and computational time might not be worth the results.
									</p>

									<h3>Bracket Loading</h3>
									<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_loading.jpg" alt="" /></span>The external forces are applied on the parts as a “bearing load”, as it would allow for a sinusoidal distribution of the load from the manifold onto the support. Split lines were made in order to allow selections of the relevant faces that would be affected by the forces,
										as illustrated.

									<h2>Bracket Bouyancy Loading</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_bouyant_setup.jpg" alt="" /></span>Based on the force calculations in the excel sheet, the manifold experience a net
										of upwards force due to the buoyancy force present when the manifold assembly is submerged. A static
										analysis must be conducted to ensure that there is enough weight to prevent the manifold to float up. A
										similar simulation through SolidWorks was done. Different restraints and bearing load conditions wre used.
									</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_bouyant_fbd.jpg" alt="" /></span> As the buoyancy force is induced by the manifold assembly, the force is
										distributed amongst the bolt holes' upper surfaces. A virtual wall restraint was also placed on to any
										surfaces that cannot deform against the lagoon floor and walls. This analysis is done in a chassis assembly, as can be seen on the figure on the right.
										This was done to include the mass of the beam as it contributes significantly to the gravitational force of the chassis resisting the
										buoyant force.

									<h2>Vibrational Study</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_vibrational_setup.jpg" alt="" /></span>Vibrational analysis is of utmost importance for this project. Rotating equipment, such as the pump and
										motor upstream, would induce a frequency excitation to the manifold array. Whenever an induced
										frequency exists in any mechanical system, an excitation amplitude might find resonance in the system.
										These amplitudes can cause loading into the systems and are undesirable since it can cause fatigue or
										even instantaneous failure. This relationship of the excitation amplitudes are a function of the natural
										frequency and induced frequency of the system, as well as the damping of the system. In a real-life
										system, with an infinite degree of freedom, there are an infinite number of frequency modes. The
										excitation frequency of the system, being the frequency of the pump, shall not reside in any of these
										mode frequencies. But with a higher mode number, the amplitude of the excitation become less and
										less relevant. Hence the avoidance of the first three modes would be the minimal requirement, with the
										addition of the avoidance of a dramatical change in excitation participation in any one direction near the
										excitation frequency.
									</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_vibrational_cempf.jpg" alt="" />
									<p>The presented graph illustrates the Modal Cumulative Effective Mass Participation Factor (CEMPF),
										showcasing its distribution across three distinct axes in relation to frequency. This insightful data
										originates from a simulation conducted on an undamped model of the system, capturing its dynamic
										characteristics without accounting for immersive attenuation effects. This graph communicates the
										percentage of the total mass being excited in the three-axial directions, growing with higher modes.
										The upstream motor and pump, both harmoniously operating at approximately 24.11 𝐻𝑧. As
										depicted, the CEMPF values along any given direction, prior to this frequency threshold,
										remain constrained within 25 % range. This observation underscores the systems resilience to
										excessive modal participation in its pre-operational state. Furthermore, the operational frequency
										distinctly segregated itself from the collection high-magnitudes modes, indicating a favorable isolation
										from potential resonant interactions. The vibrational study was conducted with no damping
										consideration from the wastewater, which would only reduce the amplification caused by the excitation
										frequency.
									</p>
									<h2>Fatigue</h2>
									<p>All objects under any type of loading undergoes fatigue, as the loading it experiences varies throughout
										its lifetime. Even for “static” objects, small variations of loading would cause an alternating loading
										condition that would reduce the strength of the object below its yield strength.
									</p>
									<p>	
										In the case of the support chassis, it is of the utmost importance that a fatigue analysis is conducted.
										Although the load experienced by the chassis would ideally be constant throughout its operation, it
										would be unlikely. Rotating equipment, such as the pump that is present in the aeration system, are
										subject to frequency changes. Even if the change of the amplitude is low, the fact that the injector
										nozzle is expected to have a lifetime of five years, the reduced strength of the part would drop
										significantly from its yield strength. This is due to a logarithmic relationship between the material
										strength and its lifetime under time-varying loads, to put it simply, parts that experience alternating
										stress close to its yield strength has a lower lifetime.
									</p>
									<h3>Fatigue Analysis Methodlogy</h3>
											<ol>
												<li>The utilization of stress results from the static analysis in both the combined Dry-
													Weight/Operational condition and the Lifting condition.</li>
												<li>The justification and use of stress-life tabulated values of 316 Stainless-steel.</li>
												<li>The specification of the desired life cycle of the chassis based on the requirements of the
													project.</li>
												<li>The review of the fatigue analysis.</li>
											</ol>
									<h3>Stainless Steel Stress-Cycle Relationship</h3>
									<p>The United-States Nuclear Regulatory Commission had conducted several tests to observe the
										environmental effects on fatigue testing of Carbon, Low-Alloy Steels, Austenitic Stainless Steels, and
										Alloy 600. This test study was conducted to compare the results between fatigue tests done on high
										temperature immersed environment with fatigue tests based on ASME codes for fatigue testing, which
										did not take into account environmental effects that present in power-plant reactors (emersed in high-
										temperature oxidized water). The team concluded that this paper would be a good source of reference
										for the S-N curve to be used in the fatigue simulations. The wastewater condition, having high
										temperature (50 𝐶) oxygenated water, would receive a more conservative strength-life relationship
										compared to a S-N curve derived from the elastic modulus from the material.
									</p>
									<p>It was found that the temperature range (25 °𝐶 - 450 °𝐶)
										did not greatly affect the fatigue strength of type 304 and 316 Stainless Steel [5]. Hence the recommended ASME tabulated data for fatigue-life is a
										safe assumption to use in the fatigue analysis of the chassis, which will be submerged within 40 °𝐶 -
										50 °𝐶 water.
									</p>
									<p>Another consideration that should be made would be the effects of corrosion presented by the chemical
										make-up of the wastewater. The University of Žilina conducted a laboratory fatigue testing for high-
										cyclical lifetime (from 107 to 109 cycles) for marine grade stainless steel (304 and 316 grades). The
										purpose of their study is to generate a new S-N relationship for stainless steel that undergoes low stress
										for a long lifetime, affected by corrosion. The concern for a material under low stress is crack nucleation,
										and through this study, it was found that the endurance of 316 stainless steel was reduced to 65 𝑀𝑃𝑎
										(6.4 𝑘𝑠𝑖). The study was conducted with 12 𝑚𝑚 diameter cylindrical steel samples etched with a
										mixture of acid and glycerin, with fully reversed (loading ratio 𝑅 = −1) with a frequency of 20 𝑘𝐻𝑧 up
										to 2 × 109 𝑐𝑦𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑠
									</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_sn_curve.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<h3>Fatigue Simulation and Results</h3>
									<p>Fatigue simulations done within SolidWorks utilizes the input event from a static study. The fatigue
										analysis done takes an input from the static study on each support from its reaction obtained from the
										thrust forces, this was done as alternating stress in the system is caused by the pump motor.
										The injector nozzle system is expected to last five years before any maintenance as per specifications.
										With the frequency of 24.11 𝐻𝑧 from the pump motor, a total of 4 × 109 𝑐𝑦𝑐𝑙𝑒𝑠 are induced unto the
										supports. The loading ratio was chosen to be 𝑅 = 0.9, since it is a reasonable expected value of
										frequency variation in the pump motor. Since the S-N values utilized were from fully reversed
										experimentation, the Soderberg mean stress theory was applied to the study as it is the most
										conservative correction method.

									<h2>Design Details</h2>
									<p>Since the client already had provided specific specifications for the piping manifold, the team's primary
										focus shifted towards designing the support chassis, which encompassed the support brackets and
										beams. This phase allowed the team to concentrate on crucial aspects like material selection and costing
										to ensure the support chassis complemented the existing manifold system seamlessly.
									</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/capstone/capstone_design_details.jpeg" alt="" /></span>To proceed with the material selection, various factors were taken into account, such as the load-
										bearing capacity requirements, environmental conditions, longevity, and compatibility with existing
										manifold. Extensive research and consultations with experts in material engineering were conducted to
										identify the most suitable materials that met both performance and budgetary constraints. Recognizing
										the criticality of obtaining accurate and competitive costing information, the team proactively reached
										out to several reputable manufacturing companies. By doing so, comprehensive quotations for the
										materials, fabrication, and assembly processes involved in constructing the support chassis.
										When designing the retaining system, the team decided to source store-bought components to keep costs down.
									</p>
									<h3>Materials</h3>
									<p>The material chosen for the support chassis was SS 316 (stainless steel grade 316) due to its many
										advantages in wastewater environments. SS 316 is widely recognized for its excellent corrosion
										resistance, making it highly suitable for prolonged exposure to the harsh and corrosive conditions
										present in wastewater treatment plants. Additionally, SS 316 offers superior strength and durability,
										ensuring, the support chassis can withstand the structural loading conditions and maintain its integrity
										over an extended service life. The material’s resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion further enhances
										its reliability in wastewater applications, providing a robust and long-lasting solution for the proposed
										injector system. Moreover, SS 316’s ease of maintenance and cleaning contributes to the overall
										maintainability of the support chassis, aligning with the client’s preference for a solution that is
										relatively easier to maintain compared to other alternatives.
									</p>
									<p>
										The retaining system is comprised of store-bought components. The material for each component was
										selected due to the somewhat harsh environment of the wastewater lagoon. The wraparound rope
										cleats are made from the same material as the support chassis, 316 stainless steels. The rope used is a
										¾ inch polypropylene rope designed for wet environments, and the surface guards are a polyurethane
										foam with an adhesive back designed to be used outdoors.
									</p>
									<h3>Manufacturing</h3>
									<p>In the pursuit of improving efficiency and reducing costs, the selection of appropriate manufacturing
										methods plays a vital role. When it comes to crafting the support chassis for our project, we considered
										two primary options: waterjet cutting and plasma cutting. Each method offers distinct advantages,
										making it essential to carefully consider their respective capabilities to determine the most suitable
										approach for our precise needs.
									</p>
									<p>Water jet cutting utilizes a high-pressure stream of water to cut a wide range of materials, including
										metals, plastics, and softer substances like paper and foam. Its non-contact nature and no increase in
										temperature make it ideal for conductive metals, ensuring temperature regulations. Waterjet cutting
										offers exceptional accuracy with tolerances as low as 0.001 𝑖𝑛, resulting in superior cut quality and
										reduced secondary finishing requirements. Plasma cutting on the other hand, uses a high-pressure
										gas jet to cut conductive materials like metals and steel. It boasts higher cutting speeds, making it
										suitable for rapid production requirements. However, plasma cutting can cause stress and heat-related
										effects on the material, potentially leading to warping or distortion.
									</p>
									<p>
										The comparative analysis reveals key differences between the two methods. Waterjet cutters have
										higher running costs due to expensive abrasives, but parts can last for thousands of hours, resulting in
										lower maintenance. They support almost all materials and produce accurate, high-precision cuts with no
										heat-related effects. In contrast, plasma cutters have lower running costs and higher cutting speeds, but
										they are limited to metal-cutting applications and may require more frequent maintenance due to wear
										on parts.
									</p>
									<p>
										After careful consideration, waterjet cutting was chosen for the support chassis manufacturing due to its
										numerous advantages, which clearly outweighed the benefits offered by plasma cutting.
									</p>
									<h3>Costing</h3>
									<p>Once the design was completed the team sourced costs for each component of the system. The prices
										were then summed to reach a total price of $11,008.26.</p>
