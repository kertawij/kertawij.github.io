									<p>This project was presented as a requirement for the course MECH 450C: Energy Conversion and Storage, taught by Professor <b>Andrew Rowe</b>.
										This project was done by myself, Jersey Kertawidjaja, and my teamate <b>Pouria Fyezi Oskouei</b>.
									</p>
									<h2>Background and Objectives</h2>
									<p>One of the biggest challenges in the energy industry since industrialization is how to overcome greenhouse
										gas (GHG) emissions, especially in the past three decades. In general, there are three ways to alleviate this
										problem: 1- Utilizing more efficient energy systems 2- Using renewable energy sources 3- Finding a way to
										lower the ever-growing amount of GHGs already being emitted in the atmosphere over a long time.
									</p>
									<p>
										The latter method will be the focus of this project. Since carbon dioxide (CO2) presents itself as a major
										GHG causing climate change, it is the substance in particular that is aimed to be reduced. To have a better
										understanding as to why this is an issue to be addressed, the pre-industrial CO2 amount in the atmosphere
										was 280ppm (part per million) or less. However, this has risen to more than 419ppm. This increase
										indicates that the amount of CO2 released in the past two centuries is more than 1T tons (1012 Tons=1015
										Kg). The increase causing climate change, which is one of the determinant reasons resulting in 1.2 °C
										increase in average global temperature relative to the late-19th century. It is estimated, with the same
										slope of GHG emissions, at the end of this century the mole fraction of CO2 in the atmosphere will reach
										about 800ppm which will result in more than 4.5 °C temperature rise globally.
									</p>
									<p>
										One of the proposed and currently used method to remove carbon from the atmosphere is called Direct
										Air Capture (DAC), which involves the capture of CO2 directly from ambient air. It uses a combination of
										chemical processes and engineered systems to selectively extract CO2 molecules from the atmosphere,
										even when it is present in trace amounts. DAC facilities typically consist of large fans or other air intake
										mechanisms that draw in air, which is then processed through a series of chemical sorbents or absorbents
										designed to capture the CO2. Once the CO2 is captured, it can be separated from the sorbent, compressed,
										and stored for subsequent use or long-term sequestration.
									</p>
									<p>
										The captured CO2 can be used for a variety of purposes, including carbon-neutral fuel production,
										enhanced oil recovery, or for direct underground storage in geological formations. DAC is considered a
										promising technology for addressing the challenge of reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and
										mitigating climate change. However, it is still relatively expensive and energy-intensive compared to some
										other carbon removal methods.

									<h2>Methods</h2>
									<p>The purpose of this project is to conduct an exergetic analysis of a DAC system coupled with a power cycle
										(that runs on natural gas) and see how DAC affects the efficiency of the system. This configuration of biogas
										power cycle and carbon capture is called Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and is quite
										an alluring solution to the climate issue.
									</p>
									<p>
										The exergy destruction in the system can be pointed out in the process and so does respective solutions
										to alleviate them. Moreover, as opposed to the DAC plants being currently run, we aim to find a better
										input energy source (other than natural gas, which in its own utilization produces CO2) and evaluate their
										corresponding feasibility.
									</p>
									<p>
										Throughout the upcoming sections of the report, exergy analysis of a power cycle and CCS will be
										conducted separately. Total exergy destruction will be calculated from the cumulative amount of each
										device of each system, done to allocate the locations of large exergy destruction. The exhaust of the power
										cycle system would then be coupled with the inlet air of the CCS. The affects of change in concentrations
										can be noticed in CCS fuel requirements, and so does how the CCS affects the efficiency of the power cycle,
										as it requires more fuel input. 
									</p>

									<h2>Result of Exergetic Analysis</h2>

									<p>Exergetic calculations need to be done on the power cycle system as well as the carbon capture
										component. Exergy of the states present in the components must be defined. Below are the expressions
										that will be used for defining the exergetic values:
									</p>
									

									<h4>Energy Balance</h4>
									<p class="MathJax_Display">\[{dE \over dt}=Q-W+\sum{ \dot {m_i}} {h_i}^* - \sum{ \dot {m_e}} {h_e}^* \]</p>
									<h4>Exergetic Balance</h4>
									<p class="MathJax_Display">\[{dE_x \over dt}=\sum{ {\dot E_{xQ}}} - \dot W + \sum{ {\dot m e_{xf}}} - \dot \Pi_D\]</p>
									<h4>Flow Exergy</h4>
									<p class="MathJax_Display">\[e_{xf} \equiv (h-h_0) - T_0(s-s_0)+ {{V^2}\over2} + gz +e_{ch}  \]</p>
									<h4>Chemical Exergy</h4>
									<p class="MathJax_Display">\[\bar e_{ch} = \sum_{\alpha}^n(\bar e_{ch} + \bar R T_0 ln(x_\alpha))x_\alpha \]</p>
									<h4>System Efficiency</h4>
									<p class="MathJax_Display">\[\eta_{system} = {E_P \over E_F} = 1 - {E_D \over E_F} \]</p>

									<h3>natural gas power cycle analysis</h3>

									<p>In order to compare the system effeciency of a typical natural gas (methane) power cycle, equipt with CCS,
										with a biogas (methane from biological sources) power cycle system absent CCS, the schematic of the
										process of power generation is needed.

									<h2>Carbon Capture System</h2>

									<p>According to Carbon Engineering, the goal set for the outflow of compressed CO2 is nearly 1 Mt-
										CO2/year, which is equivalent to 114.155 t-CO2/hr. To reach this value there are inflows and outflows
										which potentially have their exergetic values, which are obtained from the mentioned source. We
										evaluated two cases:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Assuming the inflow of the CCS is not power plants outflow (CCS unit not close to the power plant
											unit)</li>
										<li>Assuming the inflow of the CCS is from the upstream power plant</li>
									</ol>
									
									<h3>General Ideal Case</h3>

									<div class="table-wrapper">
										<table>
											<thead>
												<tr>
													<th>Atmospheric Air Flow rate</th>
													<th>powerplant exhaust flow rate</th>
												</tr>

											<tbody>
												<tr>
													<td>251,000 t-Air/hr</td>
													<td>114.7 t-PPE/hr</td>
												</tr>
											</tbody>
										</table>
									</div>

									<p>At the first glance, the amount of NG might seem a bit trivial, however considering the mole fraction of CO2
										it will be shown that this amount is comparable to the atmospheric inflow.
									</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/exergy/exergy_ccs_ideal_seperation.png" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Separation work is determined as follows (assuming all CO2 gets absorbed):</p>
									
									<p class="MathJax_Display">\[{\Delta S_{mix} \over 1t CO_2}=-\bar R T_0 ln X_{CO_2} \]</p>

									<p>Accounting for two inflows with different mole fractions, the total mixing entropy will be 2.242 MJ/K for
										1𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝐶𝑂2. With that the amount of work for separating can be determined as:
									</p>

									<p class="MathJax_Display">\[{\dot W}=\dot n_{CO_2} T_0 \Delta S_{mix} \]</p>

									<p>Therefore, the separation work in an ideal condition (no entropy generation and ideal mixture assumption)
										will be 20.412 MW. However, we know this is not possible to achieve therefore we must account for the irreversibilities occurring into the system.
									</p>

									
									<h3>Ideal Case: Upstream Power plant case</h3>

									<p>For this case according to the calculation for the power plant, the composition of the inflow is totally
										different from that of the general ideal case. To make a good comparison we assume the same amount
										of carbon removal (1 Mt of CO2/year) for this case as well. the exhaust from PP unit is composed of 9.5%
										CO2 19% O2 71.5% N2 for this composition we will have to invest 4.21 MW of work. The difference is
										remarkable which all comes from the composition. According to the second law of thermodynamics the
										more percentage of molar fraction the more convenience we will have in separating that substance. The
										surge from 420 PPM to 9.5 percent is almost three orders of magnitude difference.
									</p>
									<h2>Non Ideal</h2>
									<h3>Non Ideal: Absorption Subsystem for the general case</h3>

									<p>To make the modeling process easier to perceive, the CCS is broken down into two parts which are absorption and desorption. In this part
										absorption is to be evaluated to realize how much we have to pay for fighting against exergy destruction (entropy generation or irreversibilities).
									</p>
									<p>The beginning component of this subsystem is Contractor. In this component, air gets drawn into the
										system from the surrounding and gets in contact with sorbent material which are coated with KOH which
										is used to make CO2 adhere to itself. A simplified model of contractor can be shown as below:
									</p>

									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/exergy/exergy_ccs_contractor.png" alt="" /></span>

									<p>After this component, the flows are to be drawn into the next step in absorption part which is Pellet
										reactor. To illustrate inflows and outflows and avoid unwanted complexity the following graph can be
										useful:
									</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/exergy/exergy_ccs_pelletreactor.png" alt="" /></span>

									<p>To see these two components as a whole and take a comprehensive look at the whole absorption part, we
									can evaluate the subsystem as follows:
									</p>
									
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/exergy/exergy_ccs_abs_nonideal.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>To evaluate the amount of destruction into the subsystem, we consider some assumptions:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>The mixtures are ideal</li>
										<li>The model used for gases are ideal gas and the specific heat is constant (constant temperature
											through the process)
										</li>
										<li>Solid materials’ chemical exergy can be neglected compared to that of gases
											Atmospheric air is N2 and O2 and a very small portion of CO2
										</li>
										<li>The amount of work exerted on the system is negligible as it is only for fan and to circulate some
											solid material (Pellets and KOH) compared to the exergy of exhaust
										</li>
									</ol>
									<p>With that, we can write the exergy balance in the system:</p>

									<p class="MathJax_Display">\[{\dot E_{x,exhauset}} = \dot E_{x,D} + \dot E_{x,D-air} \]</p>

									<p>As the depleted air has a composition of an atmospheric air (0.21𝑂2 + 0.79𝑁2 ) we can ignore the effect
										of 𝐶𝑂2 which in order of 𝐸 − 4 in terms of percentage. So, the balance reduces to:
									</p>
									<p class="MathJax_Display">\[{\dot E_{x,exhauset}} = \dot E_{x,D} \]</p>

									<p>The exergetic value for this is only compositional therefore:</p>
									<p class="MathJax_Display">\[{\dot E_{x,exhauset}} = \dot n \bar e_{ch} \]</p>
									<p>Thus, exergy destruction for this subsystem is determined 2.246 MW.</p>

									<h3>Non Ideal: Absorption Subsystem for the upstream powerplant case</h3>
									<p>For this case the idea and process stay the same. However, because of changing in composition the
										values come out differently. Below, the schematic of this subsystem for this case is shown:
									</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/exergy/exergy_ccs_abs.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>This is somewhat the same as the previous assumption except we have one more term and that is PP
										exhaust which is accounting for the upstream incoming flow. The exergy for this flow is 9.32 MW, so we
										must add these two terms (2.246 MW that we calculated previously) the total amount would be 11.566
										MW. This is more than 5 times increase, which is mainly coming from the mass flow rate of this flow (210
										kg/s) which is almost 7 times higher than that of NG exhaust.
									</p>
									<h3>Non Ideal: Desorption system</h3>
									<p>Now that CO2 has been absorbed by the previous sub-system it is time to desorb it from the absorption’s
										output material. Loosely speaking this subsystem incorporates different methods to deliver heat in order
										to make desorption happen.
									</p>
									<p>The first step is pre-heating in steam slaker along with calciner, as the purpose of this work is to emphasis
										on the exergy perspective of the system, the following can bring about the holistic picture in terms of
										inflows and outflows.
									</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/exergy/exergy_ccs_slakercalciner.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The last combined-component is water knockout and compression unit. Water-knockout unit is to
										condense and remove a decent portion of moisture from the mixed entering gas. Lastly, CO2 gets
										compressed up to 151 bar and almost 40 degrees to leave the CCS. Following shows a simple and more
										understandable model for these two components as a whole.
									</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/exergy/exergy_ccs_ideal_waterko.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>As before to make the exgertic analysis process easier to visualize, we combine these two and come up
										with the overall desorption subsystem:
									</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/exergy/exergy_ccs_desorption.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>First, we have to find the molar rates coming and leaving the system, according to Carbon Engineering [5]
										incoming CH4 molar flow rate is 19.7 t/hr using the stoichiometric ratios for natural gas the molar flow
										rate for water and Oxygen would be specified which are 342 mol/s and 684 mol/s respectively. The same
										assumption we made for the previous exergy analysis, we can conclude that following is the exergy balance
										for this subsystem (we assume all the subsystem is to be run by natural gas and no work input needed):
									</p>
									<p class="MathJax_Display">\[{\dot E_{x,CH_4,Chemical}+\dot E_{x,O_2,Chemical}} = \dot E_{x,O_2,Thermo-mechanical} + \dot E_{x,CO_2,Chemical} + \dot E_{x,CO_2+H_2O,Chemical} + \dot E_{x,D} \]</p>
									<p>By running the calculation exergy destruction for this subsystem will come out as 237.85 MW. As it is clear
										the second subsystem makes 100 of the first subsystem’s exergy destruction by a reasonable rounding up
										we can approximate the whole exergy amount (the sum of both exergy destructions) as 240 MW for
										separating 186 t of CO2/hr from both natural gas power plant exhaust (160 t of CO2/hr) and natural gas
										burning into the system because of calciner and heating (26 t of CO2/hr). Also, for the upstream case the
										difference is only in the first subsystem therefore exergetic value is 250 MW which means we need nearly
										10 more mega watts to compensate.
									</p>
									<p>Note that for the recent sections we did not differentiate the two cases because after the absorption unit
										the amount of flows that the system holds stays the same which is proportional to the annual amount of
										CO2 per year which for both cases is 1 mega tons. So, the ratio of carbon throughout the system remains
										the same. Therefore, we can conclude for the desorption system we have to spend the same amount of
										energy as we do for the general case.
									</p>
									<h2>Combination of powerplant and ccs</h2>
									<p>The purpose of this section is to evaluate the coexistence of CCS and PP unit in a system at the same
										time, in a way that the inflow for CCS is sourced from PP’s exhaust. As mentioned, this flow is almost 210
										kg/s and CO2’s mole fraction in this flow is 9.5%.
									</p>
									<span class="image fit"><img src="images/exergy/exergy_ccs_combined.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>As it is seen from Figure 16, we neglect the air flow coming to the system which is actually a very big
										amount however no exergetic value involved in it. The remarkable point in this combined system is
										almost half the amount of methane being used in powerplant has to be spent for the CCS, this fact
										decreases the whole system’s efficiency. To calculate the efficiency and come up the important values of
										the system the following chart is shown:
									</p>
									<div class="table-wrapper">
										<table>
											<thead>
												<tr>
													<th>Exergy Flow</th>
													<th>Values</th>
												</tr>
											</thead>
											<tbody>
												<tr>
													<td>Total methane</td>
													<td>17.07 kg/s</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Turbine work (Powerplant)</td>
													<td>143.58 MW</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Compressed CO2</td>
													<td>1 Mt of CO2/year</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Heat from PP</td>
													<td>490 MW at 323 K</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Heat from the CCS</td>
													<td>63 MW (calculated in the work loss) at 294 K</td>
												</tr>
											</tbody>
										</table>
									</div>
									<p>To amount of exergetic flow for the heat coming out of PP is somewhat remarkable, although the quality
										of this heat is only 15.5% the amount is considerable. Maybe there could be some way to take advantage
										of this such as preheating process in CCS as can be seen in.
									</p>
									<p>All in all, the total efficiency of the system is calculated according to these values, which comes at
										18.20% considering the 25.32% powerplant efficiency, this value is somehow not too bad.
									</p>
									<h2>Evaluation of sources for biogas</h2>
									<p>The exergetic analysis conducted in section 3 was done using methane natural gas (CH4), of no source. But
										when considering natural gas sources and carbon emissions, it is very important to consider the carbon
										emission from the cradle to grave of the substance/product. In the late 90s the first concept of bioenergy
										with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) was included in a book published by The United Nations
										University Press, authored by Robert H. Williams. Williams proposed a biomass source energy generation
										with carbon capture and sequestration technology. He concluded that the proposed system would induce
										a net negative carbon emission to the earth’s atmosphere [7]. The quick rundown of BECCS is as illustrated
										in Figure 17.
									</p>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/exergy/exergy_BECCS.png" alt="" /></span>

									<p>The reason why BECCS is considered net negative in emission is because the source of its fuel is obtained
										from forest biomass. Forests naturally capture carbon from the atmosphere from due to the
										photosynthesis process, hence if the CO2 emitted from a biogas powerplant is equal to the amount of CO2
										absorbed by the trees that had been used up as fuel, the net carbon emission on the earth’s atmosphere
										would be zero. Hence if an additional CCS is added as part of the power plant, whether it be exhaust
										capture or DAQ, the net carbon emission emitted unto the earth’s atmosphere would be a net negative.
									</p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/exergy/exergy_landrequired.png" alt="" /></span>

									<p>The idea of BECCS is very appealing in the emission strand point. But an issue that comes to mind quite
										quickly would be, “how much more energy does it take to extract biogas as compared to conventional
										methane from fossil fuel? Is it much more readily available?” Based on Figure 18, presented by a publishing
										from the Imperial College, BECCS deployment: a reality check, the land area required for BECCS ranges
										from 100 million hectares to 800 million hectares, depending on the amount of gigatons of CO2 are to be
										captured per year. If BECCS is to be deployed for the means of intensive carbon capture, about 40% of the
										world’s cropland would be used for it, causing environmental impacts on biodiversity [8].
									</p>
									<h2>Finishing thoughts</h2>
									<p>Based on the calculations done on the CCS, it was found that a change of CO2 concentration of the inlet
										changes the amount of work required significantly. The ideal work required for a DAC system that would
										capture 1 Mt of CO2/year was found to be 20.412 MW. If the carbon capture system was placed near a
										powerplant, with the aims of capturing the same amount of CO2 from the exhaust (with higher
										concentration), the ideal work was found 4.21 MW, a significant reduction to a typical direct air capture.
										On the side of the power plant on the other hand, adding a CCS into the system would reduce its efficiency
										from 25.32% to 18.20%.
									</p>
									<p>The argument for BECCS is made based on the idea of “net negative” carbon emissions that it can provide.
										The idea of producing power while reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is very
										alluring. Although arguments have been made against BECCS due to the fact that in order for it to be net
										negative, the source of heat for its power cycle must come from bioenergy, trees in particular since they
										are they present themselves are naturally occurring carbon capture devices. And as discussed in this
										report, the amount of land that is required to generate energy and capture carbon is quite significant,
										ranging between 100 million to 800 million hectares. Such an increase of cropland would cause a balance
										in biodiversity.
